<h1 style="color: darkred;">About Me</h1>

I am currently working at Huawei <img src='./images/huawei.png' style='width: 1.5em;'> as a research **Principle Engineer** in RAN Research Department II. 

My work is primarily focused on the standardization for **3GPP Release 20/21 physical layer MIMO air interface technologies**, which mainly include the evolution of the following key components:

- Sounding Reference Signals (SRS)
- Channel State Information Reference Signals (CSI-RS)
- Codebook Framework Design
- PMI (Precoding Matrix Indicator) Feedback Mechanisms

In addition to my technical responsibilities, I also serve as the **Technical Leader** for exploratory projects in the following emerging areas:

- AI-assisted Integration for Uplink and Downlink Channels
- Movable-Antenna Architecture Technologies
- Ultra-Massive MIMO Full-Connected Hybrid Beamforming Technologies
- Channel Graph-Assisted Communication Technologies

At Huawei, I focused on the technology research and standardization of MIMO for **5G Advanced and 6G**, which enabled me to accumulate substantial experience in **translating academic knowledge into industrial applications**. I actively keep pace with the latest advancements in academic research, particularly in areas such as **terahertz communications**, **ultra-massive MIMO**, **movable antenna systems**, **intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS)**, and **integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)**. If you are seeking any form of **academic collaboration**, please feel free to email me at [boydning@outlook.com](mailto:boydning@outlook.com).

<div style="background-color: #f5f5f5; padding: 10px;">
I graduated from Yingcai Honors College (英才实验学院), University of Electronic and Technology of China (UESTC, 电子科技大学), with a **Bachelor's degree** in 2018 and from the National Key Laboratory of Wireless Communications (通信抗干扰全国重点实验室), UESTC, with a **Ph.D** in 2023, supervised by [Zhi Chen (陈智)](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?hl=en&user=wnGtLtsAAAAJ). In 2018, I visited Lady Margaret Hall at the University of Oxford (牛津大学) as an **Exchange Student** and worked on the Heavy Goods Vehicles Project. During the latter half of 2021, I worked as an **Intern** at Huawei's 2012 Wireless Communication Laboratory (华为2012无线通信实验室), focusing on MU-MIMO beamforming research. From 2022 to 2023, I was a **Visiting Scholar** with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (电气与计算机工程系), National University of Singapore (新加坡国立大学), supervised by [Rui Zhang (张瑞)](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?hl=en&user=yoJqPIkAAAAJ). From 2023 to now,  I was a research **Principe Engineer** with the Huawei RAN Research Department II (无线网络系统技术研究二部), Chengdu, China.

Over the research period, I have made significant contributions to [IEEE ComSoc](https://www.comsoc.org/), with over 50 top-tier [IEEE journal and conference papers published](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086638264) (including 20 as the first author). These publications span prestigious journals such as **IEEE JSAC**, **IEEE WCM**, **IEEE TWC**, **IEEE TCOM**, **IEEE IoT**, **IEEE TVT**, **IEEE WCL**, and **IEEE CL**, as well as renowned conferences like **IEEE GLOBECOM**, **IEEE ICC**, **IEEE ICASSP**, and **IEEE WNCN**. Additionally, I have secured over 10 national patents and co-authored 1 book. My expertise has been internationally recognized with **2 ESI highly cited paper**, **1 IEEE featured journal article**, and **8 IEEE popular papers**. 

In 2022, I was honored to be funded by the [China Scholarship Council (CSC)](https://www.chinesescholarshipcouncil.com/) for a visiting PhD in the National University of Singapore. Meanwhile, I was awarded the [National Scholarship for Ph.D](http://www.moe.gov.cn/jyb_xwfb/xw_zt/moe_357/jyzt_2015nztzl/2015_zt06/15zt06_gxzzzc/gxzz_yjs/201508/t20150810_199224.html) (the highest academic honor for Ph.D students in China). I won the election for [UESTC Top 10 Outstanding Students](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%88%90%E7%94%B5%E6%9D%B0%E5%87%BA%E5%AD%A6%E7%94%9F/2717449) (the highest comprehensive honor for students in UESTC). In 2023, I won the election for [Huawei's Top Minds](https://career.huawei.com/reccampportal/portal5/topminds.html) (the highest recruitment honor for graduates). I won the [Outstanding Graduate Award from the Sichuan Provincial Department of Education](https://edu.sc.gov.cn/scedu/cjhfwjk/2023/3/3/cb2ff303cf1b474e86d4eeb460f87597.shtml). In 2024, I was a recipient of the [Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation Award from the China Education Society of Electronics](https://cese.xidian.edu.cn/info/1003/1495.htm) (20 individuals nationwide each year). I was a honored to be a [MSCA Postdoctoral Fellowship funded by European Union](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/actions/postdoctoral-fellowships).
